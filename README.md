# SOLVEX

### Rubiks Cube Timer
**SOLVEX** is a rubiks cube timer with various features to look and visualize at your solves time. It features a user friendly interface built for solvers, by a solver.

This is my first ReactJS project after learning its fundamentals and made me strenghten my react knowledge. I also recently just received my rubiks cube from Hack Club - High Seas and been obssessed with it. 
I've been using a stopwatch when solving it and this is where I got the idea of creating my own rubiks cube timer using react.
